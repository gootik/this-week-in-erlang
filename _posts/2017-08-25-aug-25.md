Hello and welcome to "This week in Erlang"! As expected, there was a lot of action on the OTP side this week, and maybe a little too slow everywhere else. However, there was a piece of great news that came out this week. Read on!

### Articles and Blog posts
 * Bet365's CEO announced that they will be buying all of Basho's remaining assets and making everything open source: <http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2017-August/019500.html>

 * There was a discussion on Hackernews about Pierre Fenoll's Supercompiler Pass project: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15064127>

 * Andrew Bennett (@potatosaladx) wrote another great article this week. It is about load testing Cowboy 2.0 and how it holds against Cowboy 1.1. Highly recommend reading it: <https://potatosalad.io/2017/08/20/load-testing-cowboy-2-0-0-rc-1.html>
 
### Library updates
 * Cowboy 2.0-rc2 was released with bunch of important bug fixes: <https://ninenines.eu/articles/cowboy-2.0.0-rc.2/>

 * A new version of Rebar3 was released. Hurry and update since it's a big release: <https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/releases/tag/3.4.3>


### OTP Updates
 * OTP 20.0.3 was released this week, with what seems like a few security fixes. Read about it at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-programming/ThszrBokews and download the new package at https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-20.0.3

 * There was a lot of PR merging happening on master OTP branch. But one that I particularly liked was Björn's BEAM imporvement commit. Prepare for performance improvements coming in the next release: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/fbf740d68600b59dc5fa7bd76d0aa0d019e81a75>

### Library of the week
A very cool library that I still have not found a good use for is Inaka's Niffy library. It was created by Brujo Benavides (@elbrujohalcon) and Hernán Rivas Acosta (@hernanrivasacosta) to make adding NIFs to Rebar3 projects easier. Have a look and see if it solves any of your problems:

Niffy: https://github.com/inaka/niffy

### Project of the week
On one of the Erlang mailing list threads, Joe linked to `Skel` as a framework for making concurrent Erlang easier. I had forgotten about it, but this library/framework is really interesting and definitely worth a look:
