Welcome to another packed “This week in Erlang” newsletter! I wanted to start with pointing to this tweet by Jesper Louis ([@jlouis666][1]) that I found funny/interesting. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Note that systems with less than 1024 schedulers (cores) are not affected by the bug” .. Since OTP 18.0 :) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OTP</a>-14548 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/erlang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#erlang</a></p>&mdash; Jesper L. Andersen (@jlouis666) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlouis666/status/916021955454799873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

Now for the real stuff:

### Articles and Blog posts

- Amazing milestone for *Loïc Hoguin* ([@lhoguin][2]) for his release of Cowboy 2.0. [Read the announcement for yourself][3].

- Erlang solutions ran a webinar with *Martin Sumner* ([@masleeds][4]), a technical consultant at NHS (National Health Service for England) on their planned enhancements for Riak. 
[Watch/listen to the YouTube upload][5].

- *Dmytro Lytovchenko* ([@kvakvs][6]) did the inevitable and started working on a Rust implementation of the BEAM VM. While people may refer to this as "rust syndrome", I think it would be a huge help to the community even as practice. [Checkout the repo for progress or contribute][7].

- *Shakthi Kannan* ([@shakthimaan][8]) wrote an article on using Ansible for building OTP VMs. [Take a look and maybe learn from his experiences][9].

- There was an interesting discussion happening on the Erlang mailing lists about McErlang and Concuerror libraries. Have a read here: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-programming/G6Zxs_LrkVc>

- *Kacper Mentel* ([@mkacper][10]) wrote an article on using ErlangPL on a real world project and what he found out. [He broke down the problem, the solution, and the process really well][11].

### Library Updates
- `kerl` was updated by *Mark Allen* ([@bytemeorg][12]) this week to support older versions of Erlang on High Sierra (MacOS 10.13). You can read about the problem and the solution here: <https://github.com/kerl/kerl/pull/230>

### OTP Updates
- A very important (and exciting) PR that we talked about a few weeks ago finally got merged into the master OTP branch. This is the multi IO polling threads that is expected to bring a significant performance improvements to heavily utilized systems. Check out the details here: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1552>

### Library of the week
This week we have another library from *Fred Hèbert* ([@mononcqc][13])! `Fancyflow` is a library that allows you to nicely manage your application flow. It is written as a parse transform and could really clean-up your messy code :):

<https://github.com/ferd/fancyflow>

### Events and Meetups
- London Erlang User group is sponsoring a talk on Oct 11th. The talk, hosted by *Areegee* ([@AreegeAlZubaidi][14]), is about "Building the ideal betting stack", checkout the details here: <https://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup/events/243643887/>

### Employment
- Helium is looking for Erlang/Rust engineers: <https://angel.co/helium-2/jobs/281695-software-engineer>

### Announcements
- I should have thought about this earlier, but if you want to be featured on the newsletter you can use the `#twie` hashtag in your tweets and I'll pick them up at the end of the week!

- There is an Atom feed of this newsletter here:
