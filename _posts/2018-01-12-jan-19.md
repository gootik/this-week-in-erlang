Welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter. We had a fairly slow week.
But interesting stuff.

### Articles and Blog posts

- *ikura* ([@ikura_wild][1]) has create a new library that makes talking (sending messages) to other languages much easier. [Checkout the article here][2]

- *Jesse Gumm* ([@jessegumm][3]) did a talk on "parse transforms" and Erlang metaprogramming. [He has released the slides online, so have a look][4]

### Library Updates
- *Lager* had a "YUUUUGE" update :) <https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager#3x-changelog>

### OTP Updates
- If you happen to look at the erlang/otp repo you may have noticed 
that a lot of performance PRs have been merged. One of more interesting ones
is the recent change in argument rearranging. *Björn Gustavsson* ([@bgustavsson][5]) has a pretty
good write up in the PR description so take a look for sure: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1687>

- Another big news is that there is now no "sender punishment" in BEAM. This meant if a process sent a message to another process with too many messages 
in the mailbox, it would get "punished" and have it's reductions increased by _4_. [The reasoning is explained here][6]

### Library of the week

*Tomasz Maciejewski* has written a search engine in Erlang! This application includes a complete web UI frontend/indexing with a scalable crawler. It is really amazing how clean and well thought out the whole application design is. I would say `see` is a great repo to lookup to, both for Erlang beginners and people with experience. Check it out and run it on your own computer:

### Events and Meetups
- If you haven't heard, Erlang Factory has been renamed to Code BEAM ([@CodeBEAMio][7])! Read about this year's conference here: <https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sf-2018/>
