Welcome to another "This week in Erlang" newsletter.

### Articles and Blog posts
- *Roberto Aloi* ([@robertoaloi](https://twitter/robertoaloi)): Redbug is a debugging and tracing utility for Erlang. The article presents some recently added features to redbug, showing how to use them. - <https://medium.com/@robertoaloi/tracing-child-processes-with-redbug-684b647c12a1>

- *Erlang Solutions* ([@erlangsolutions](https://twitter/erlangsolutions)): Oleg Tarasenko from ErlangSolutions wrote an article explaining how to use Docker to run and manage your Erlang distribution. This is an article to help you "modernize" your tech setup :) - <https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/running-distributed-erlang-elixir-applications-on-docker.html>

- *Ross Schlaikjer* ([@rschlaikjer](https://twitter/rschlaikjer)): This article goes over Erlang NIFs (Native Implemented Functions) and how to use them. Ross shows how you can take a slow pure Erlang implementation and make it performant. - <https://rhye.org/post/native-methods-in-erlang/>

- *Neeraj Sharma* ([@nsharma9](https://twitter/nsharma9)): Neeraj goes over [Marina](https://github.com/lpgauth/marina) and few other Erlang tools/libraries for dealing with Cassandra. A great read. - <https://medium.com/@nsharma9/high-performance-erlang-cassandra-client-marina-f7e93edf8677>

- *Lazarus Lazaridis* ([@lazaru_s](https://twitter/lazaru_s)): It's not about Erlang but it is something a lot of developers might want to do for their own command line tools or workflow. This is a nice step-by-step tutorial that describes how to build a bash completion script for your CLIs. - <https://opensource.com/article/18/3/creating-bash-completion-script>
