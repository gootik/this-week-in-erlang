Welcome to another week of Erlang action. The good news is that this week we saw a lot of action on the OTP repo. Bad news is that not so much went on in the community. But we still have couple of cool things to look at!

### Articles and Blog posts
 * Tristan (@t_sloughter) wrote an article on how SpaceTime uses Kubernetes and Erlang, definitley check it out: <https://spacetimeinsight.com/installing-monitoring-erlang-releases-kubernetes-helm-prometheus/>
 
### Library updates

 * Looking-glass got some updates this week. Loïc (@lhoguin) updated guides and support for sequence diagrams: <https://github.com/rabbitmq/looking-glass>

 * Erlang.mk got a cool new feature where you can pin the OTP version in your build. It is handled through kerl, and is a good way to keep everyone on your team on the same OTP build: <https://github.com/ninenines/erlang.mk>


### OTP Updates
This week we saw some interesting PRs and updates going into OTP master branch (OTP21) :
 * This PR by Michal Muskala (@michalmuskala) helps with optimzation of your case statements <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1511>

 * Björn (bgustavsson) merged couple of PRs to optimize "one-armed" case statesments: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1528>

 * Observer also got some love by showing more statistics, thanks to Gabriele Santomaggio (@GSantomaggio) : <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1484>

### Library of the week
This week I wanted to highlight a project that has helped me plenty. `xprof` by Appliscale is an amazing application that runs in your VM and allows you to time any function that is running. The UI is very simple, and it also allows you to capture any function calls that take more than a specified time. Use it to find your bottlenecks and make things faster!

### Project of the week
[nonsense.ws](http://nonsense.ws) is trying to run some sort of a distributed AI system. Read more about their research and technology on their website <https://nonsense.ws/research>. The idea seems interesting, however, I wish their website was a bit more informative.
