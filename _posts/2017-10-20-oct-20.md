Welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! 

### Articles and Blog posts

- *Brujo Benavides* ([@elbrujohalcon][1]) and *Marcos Almonacid* ([@@m_amilkr][2]) have decided to host another SpawnFest! What is that you ask? [Go over to their website and get excited][3].

- *Marcelo Gornstein* ([@mgornstein][4]) wrote another yet another article this week and it's about serving [FastCGI with Erlang and Cowboy][5].

- *Brujo Benavides* wrote his [second article on Erlang behaviors][6]. [If you missed part one, read it here][7].

- *Snorri Sturluson* ([@CCP_Snorlax][8]) continues with his Erlang adventures, [this time it's about Replication Mnesia][9].

- Head over to Erlang Solutions's website for [latest news on WombatOAM release][10].

- *Sergey Prokhorov* ([@seriyps][11]) sent out a link to a [benchmark of different Erlang data structures][12]. Definitely worth a look.

### Library Updates
- [Hackney 1.10.0 and Hackney 1.10.1][13] have been released with bunch of important bug fixes.

### OTP Updates
*Siri Hansen* open an interesting PR this week, to optimize how supervisors store their
children data. This is most interesting if you ever need to run a large number of 
children as the new design is more memory compact and faster:

### Library of the week
I'm so glad I asked for a suggestion for this week on the Erlanger Slack. The reason being Fred introduced me to this amazing library.
`docsh` created by *Radosław Szymczyszyn* ([@erszcz][14]), allows you to search Erlang/OTP docs right from the REPL. I'm sure having
this installed will boost your efficiency :) Check it out:
