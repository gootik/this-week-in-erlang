Welcome to another "This week in Erlang" newsletter. This week we have a lot of things happening! Enjoy a new set of articles from the OTP team at <http://blog.erlang.com>. 

### Announcements
- *Code BEAMSTO* ([@CodeBEAMio](https://twitter/CodeBEAMio)): Early bird ends Sat 21/04 Code BEAMSTO - previously the Erlang User Conference. 

The Erlang User Conference (EUC) has been rebranded as Code BEAMSTO. It is still a two-day, multi-track event on Erlang programming language with elements of Elixir and other BEAM languages. We focus on real-world applications of Erlang, concurrency, distributed computing and scalability. We strive to bring together people passionate about the Erlang Ecosystem and high-performance, massively scalable distributed systems.

Join us between 31 May - 1 June, plus a free day of tutorials. There are also many in-depth training options available, find out more on the website.

### Articles and Blog posts
- *Brujo Benavides* ([@elbrujohalcon](https://twitter/elbrujohalcon)): A beautiful blog post, also titled "Beautiful Code", that takes you through an artistic side of Erlang. Brujo uses Erlang code to write poems. Check it out. - <https://medium.com/erlang-battleground/beautiful-code-254a5f8ef958>

- *Bj√∂rn Gustavsson* ([@bgustavsson](https://twitter/bgustavsson)): Another great article from the OTP dev team! This time about the Erlang Compiler and the 'time' feature. Have a look, very interesting stuff. - <http://blog.erlang.org/compiler-time-option/>

- *Kenny Bergquist* ([@kenforthewin92](https://twitter/kenforthewin92)): This article talks about how Erlang teaches you to think about distributed systems. It also, briefly, compares Kubernetes (as a distributed system) vs. Erlang VM. - <https://blog.kenforthewin.com/what-erlang-taught-me-about-distributed-systems/>

### OTP Updates
- *Lukas Larsson* ([@garazdawi](https://twitter/garazdawi)): As you may remember, we found out that the OTP team was starting a Blog. It turns out, they are ready to share the news with everyone with an article on IO Polling on OTP 21! This is very exciting; the more insight we get on the inner workings of BEAM and the more we know what the team is working on, the better. - <http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/>

- *Henrik Nord* ([@Proxyles](https://twitter/Proxyles)): As you may know, OTP 21 is planned for release on June 20th with the first release candidate on May 2nd. If you are planning to submit a PR, do it now! Read more, in the mailing list link. - <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-programming/_cjAzhkX26w>
