First of all, sorry for missing last week's updates, I was out of town and did
not have access to Internet. This update will try to include two weeks of work!

### Articles and Blog posts
 * The talks from Erlang&Elixir Factory Buenos Aires have all been uploaded to
 YouTube. Check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWbHc_FXPo2gZTX5oTYvIqTtKvS6WNNq8).

 * Juan Facorro (@jfacorro) has created a new port of Clojure that runs on the Erlang VM, called `clojerl`. Check out the amazing work: https://github.com/jfacorro/clojerl

 * CodeFights now supports Erlang as a language to code with: http://blog.codefights.com/new-supported-languages/

 * Mariano Guerra (@warianoguerra) is preparing a yearly survey template for the Erlang community. This is great work as it unites all of us towards what's best for the community. He is asking for comments/feedback before doing the proper survey, please have a look and send comments to him directly: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OrZMScZNHpFUJv5D5UWs2Abkh-dcvsPzsSqO3xVkqdU/viewform?edit_requested=true

### Library updates
 * Cowboy 2.0-rc1 has been released! Read the announcement
  [here](https://ninenines.eu/articles/cowboy-2.0.0-rc.1/) and

### OTP Updates
 * OTP 20.0.2 was released 9 days ago, and it includes some bug fixes. Read about the release [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-programming/CTJ4-l1nTfc). You can dowload it from here: https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-20.0.2

 * OTP 19.3.6.2 was also released recently, again with a few bug fixes in ERTS. Find the announcement [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-programming/skeg-6fRaOc). And download the patch here: https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-19.3.6.2

### Meetups and Courses
 * I liked this last time as well, but it doesn't hurt to over promote. There is still time to signup for University of Kent's MOOC on Erlang. https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang/

 * Erlang Solutions is running a webinar with @csierra no how Twnel uses MongooseIM. You have until August 31st to signup: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/webinars.html

### Library of the week
This week I want to introduce you to one of Fred Hebert's libraries `vmstats` that I had completely forgotten about. I had to submit a PR this week and got reminded of how well this library is written. `vmstats` is a good example of how a really small library can have a huge impact. If we can have more of these helpful but small well written libraries we can make everyone's life easier. Have a look at it here:

### Announcements
 * Everything is now on github as a Jekyll blog. If you do find mistakes or think something needs to change head on [here]() and submit a PR! You can also suggest stuff for next week there.
