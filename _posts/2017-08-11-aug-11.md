Welcome to another version of "This Week In Erlang". I think we had a slow week, but I assume it's going to pick up as the OTP seem to have came back from vacation :P. I think the biggest news of all is ErlangSolution's support for Riak. However, there is more!

### Articles and Blog posts
 * ErlangSolutions announced that they provide Basho Riak support even after Basho's death: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/riak-commercial-support-now-available-post-basho.html

 * Andrew Bennett (@potatosaladx) wrote a really good article on performance of Drivers, NIFs, and Ports here: https://potatosalad.io/2017/08/05/latency-of-native-functions-for-erlang-and-elixir.html

 * Alexander Færøy did an awesome presentation on his complete implementation of Tor on Erlang (Talla): https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-304-introducing_talla_an_erlang_implementation_of_tor

### Library updates
 * Ulf Wiger released a new version of his `jobs` library, check it out: https://github.com/uwiger/jobs

### OTP Updates
 * A lot PRs are getting attention, again. Couple of interesting compiler optmization and performance PRs are in the works.

 * You can always contribute to OTP by going to https://github.com/erlang/otp.

### Library of the week
If you have worked with Erlang long enough you have ran into a situation where you a single gen_server was not enough to handle your load. The message queue just can't keep up. You may have wrote your own batching/pooling/etc. strategy, but I want to show a very stable library to make it all easy for you. Worker_pool by Inaka is worht a look:

### Project of the week
Suggested by Mariabo (@warianoguerra) I wan't to introduce you to this amazing project that is based on Erlang. Check it out! https://bragful.com/en
