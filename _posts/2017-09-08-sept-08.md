Hello and welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! We have a lot to
share this week. But, first, I'd like to thank Mark Allen (@bytemeorg) for volunteering
to take over the newsletter while I'm gone.


### Community Announcement
*Mariano Guerra* released the first ever "State of BEAM" survey last week, I wanted
to remind you all again to fill it if you have forgotten or share it with your
network.

 * Oleksandr Kaleniuk (@okaleniuk) wrote an article on Hackermoon with the title "Why Erlang is the only true computer language". Interesting stuff: <https://hackernoon.com/why-is-erlang-the-only-true-computer-language-4c7d1f195a02>

### Library updates
 * Not really a library update, but library related :) If you like Cowboy and use it
   you can send some donations to @lhoguin to thank him: <https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/ninenines>

### OTP Updates
 * A very old PR got merged into OTP master this week. This PR by José Valim (@josevalim)
   adds a new return type for gen_server callbacks. Namely, `{continue, term()}`. Read
   the PR and get ready for OTP 20.1! <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1490>

 * Björn and Lukas keep working on extremely exciting performance updates.

### Library of the week
`istype` a library by, Charles Zilm (@Projectgoldfish), that allows for runtime
type checking in your Erlang code. It achieves this by using parse transforms and
saves a lot of hassle. Take a look:

### Project of the week
Rabl is a new project, by Russell Brown (@russelldb), that is using the Riak components to build a "replicated,
distributed database that runs as a cluster". It is definitely and interesting
project and has a lot of potential. Take a look here:

<https://github.com/nhs-riak/rabl>

Thanks to @bytemeorg for the suggestion.

### Announcements
  * Some people asked for a mailing list, so I've created one that you can signup
    to here: http://eepurl.com/c2xmWr . This means starting next week you will
    get an Email every Friday with this newsletter in it!

  * Again, thanks to @bytemeorg for picking up my slack for the next few weeks.
