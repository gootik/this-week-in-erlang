Welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! As you may have noticed it's 
been a while (too long?) since I've put out one of these. People started thinking 
this is marking the death of TWIE, that is wrong and we won't stop these newsletters! 
Ever?

Now; it's been too long for me to do a "week summary", so in this edition I'm just
including some of the things I found around recently. I'm keeping it very small 
just to get the ball rolling :)

### Articles and Blog posts

- Erlang Solutions is working on a "Erlang 101" and would like to know what things they
  should include. [You can add to their list here][1].

- *Brujo Benavides* ([@elbrujohalcon][2]) wrote two great "Erlang Battlegrounds" articles. [one is about variable binding][3] and [another one about lists:seq/2][4]. 

- *Jakub Hajto* (from [@functionalworks][5]) wrote an article on [Erlang Digraph module.][6]

### OTP Updates
New OTP versions have been released:

 - [20.1.7](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-20.1.7)
 - [19.3.6.4](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-19.3.6.4)
 - [19.2.3.1](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-19.2.3.1)
 - [18.3.4.7](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-18.3.4.7)

### Library of the week
This time we have a library/project/application from *Marcelo Gornstein* ([@mgornstein][7]).
Marcelo is writing a CI server in Erlang. This is a very ambitious and interesting project.
I'm sure he needs help wherever he can get it! So go on, clone, play around, commit, and open
a PR!
