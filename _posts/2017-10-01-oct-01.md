Hello and welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! I am finally back from my trip and will take over *Mark Allen* ([@bytemeorg][1]). Mark was wonderful to keep the newsletter going while we had momentum. We have a lot to cover so let's do it!

I've added two extra sections this week, one to cover all events and meetups that are happening and one to cover any employment opportunity that comes my way.

### Articles and Blog posts

- Big news. RabbitMQ has decided to move to Github, Bintray. [Read the announcement for yourself][2]. 

- A new book by *Gavin M. Roy* ([@crad][3]) on RabbitMQ was published! [Go ahead and order it from Manning Publications][4]

- *Luke Massey* Wrote a piece on comparing Go, Erlang, and Elixir for their use in betting systems and Bet365. [It is a pretty good read][5].

- *Mariano Guerra*'s ([@warianoguerra][6]) part 3 of his series [discussing Multi-Paxos][7] in the context of 
  riak\_ensemble is ready Take a look!. (Catch up if you missed [Part 2][8] or [Part 1][9].)

- *Dmytro Lytovchenko* ([@kvakvs][10]) gave an amazing presentation on Erlang data types and how they work internally. Watch this if you want to write efficient programs in the BEAM: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUVpYXuR80>

- *Brujo Benavides* ([@elbrujohalcon][11]) has another addition to his Erlang Battleground series. This time it is about gen_servers and how the terminate callback gets called. Very good information indeed, [read it even if you think you know all about gen_servers][12].

### OTP Updates
- OTP version 20.1 was released this week. There is a bunch of important bug fixes and new features that you should be aware of. Stay on the edge and upgrade your systems soon!

 Announcement: <http://www.erlang.org/news/115>

 Download from Github: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-20.1>

- *Tristan Sloughter* ([@t_sloughter][13]) Opened an interesting PR on OTP to allow for code upgrades without relups or any VM restarts: <https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1581>

### Library of the week
As suggested by *Mariano Guerra*, I want to show `hinterface` inspired by `Jinterface`. It is a Haskell / Erlang interoperability library and is a set of tools for communication with Erlang processes from Haskell:

### Events and Meetups
- The first ever [Indian Erlang and Elixir Factory Lite][14] will happen in
Bangalore, November 17, 2017. If you're in the vicinity, please join us!


### Employment
- Helium is looking for Erlang/Rust engineers: <https://angel.co/helium-2/jobs/281695-software-engineer>

### Announcements
- There is an Atom feed of this newsletter here:
   <https://gootik.github.io/this-week-in-erlang/feed.xml>

- You can also signup for the weekly mailing list here: <http://eepurl.com/c2xmWr>

- I have been planning to run a website just like [elixirstatus.com][15] called [erlangstatus.com][16]. 
However, I don't have enough time to maintain and change the looks of the forked codebase. I'd like to ask for everyone's help to get it going by contributing to the repo at: <https://github.com/gootik/erlangstatus>
