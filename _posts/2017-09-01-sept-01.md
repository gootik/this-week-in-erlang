Hello and welcome to "This week in Erlang"! This week bunch of interesting happened, and most importantly there is a very important announcement! Get excited.

### Community Announcement
As a community, we want to make the BEAM community better. This requires us to know who we are, what we do, what we like and what we don't like. Today, thanks to *Mariano Guerra*, we are launching the first in what hopefully becomes a yearly survey on the State of the BEAM, please fill the survey and share it widely so we get a good representation of the community.
